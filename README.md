# Web-Scraping

HERE to Scrape the data from clutch website i have used AutoScrapper as it is fast and smart way to perform the task i have choosed it

initially i have set a pattern to which the data excel should be generated based on that pattern the scrapper get the data.

then using the get_simiar_results method in the autoscapper i have generated the unique keys for the data.

later i have redefined those keys to their orginal labels so that the data will make sense

finnaly i have converted the data dictionory into the data frame and then to a excel format
